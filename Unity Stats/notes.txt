4 spots: *Four real-time shadowing spotlights
*Lightmaps are indirect-only because the real-time
lights' Bounce Intensity is > 0
*Valve Camera is set to Indirect Lightmaps Only

bad cases:*A few specific combinations of settings that
are likely to result in poor or incorrect lighting.

directional: *One real-time directional light on an animation loop
*Using Precomputed Realtime GI instead of lightmaps -
high-res directional shadows + dynamic GI

fog: *Demonstration of the Valve Fog script.
*Both distance and height fog are used here, but can
also be used independently.
*Real-time shadow resolution is turned down deliberately
to achieve the shadow softness that would accompany
a large area light on the floor.

Lightmap-override: *Valve model in this scene is using a special version
of its material that overrides its lightmaps with
a custom image. (In this case, we're reusing
its AO texture.)
*Note that models whose materials override
lightmaps need the Valve Override Lightmap
Component.

Point light: *Each point light functions internally like six spotlights
*Therefore, three shadowing point lights can be active at a time
*Simple, non-directional lightmaps
*Lightmaps are indirect-only because the real-time
lights' Bounce Intensity is > 0
